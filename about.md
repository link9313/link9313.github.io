I recently graduated with a degree in IT Innovation from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am particularly interested in audio and web technologies, but am open to many different opportunities. I also enjoy new ideas, learning, working with audio/MIDI, reading, and computer programming. I had ten years of basic self-taught programming experience on simple projects prior to beginning my formal university instruction. My dream is to make some sort of impact on the world through technology and music.
