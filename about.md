I've had a love of computer technology ever since a fateful day early in 1997. I was four years old at the time my parents obtained our first computer. Most interestingly, this computer was not even relatively new. It was an IBM PCjr from 1984, a gift from our uncle. That's right, my first computer was already 13 years old when I first used it. To this day, I still have a love of retro computing in general. The simplicity of MS-DOS is sometimes refreshing compared to today's machines.

Several years later, my brother and I were sharing computers, and then using our own machines. During this time was I when I first discovered how to program, on an IBM PS/2 Model 70, another gift, this time from my Grandma, who used the machine as an office secretary. On this computer, we stumbled upon a little program called Microsoft QBASIC. It didn't take my brother long to learn that we could use this program to create programs of our own. Now this version of BASIC, couldn't create compiled programs, but that didn't stop us from trying to design and build our own games.

We eventually moved on to Microsoft QuickBASIC to compile our own programs, and then to FreeBASIC, finally bringing our QBASIC background to Windows. During this time we experimented with various other game development systems, particularly for point-and-click adventure games.

Fast forward to now, where I have a bachelor's degree in IT Innovation from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I spend my free time learning and tinkering with anything computer-like (read: it has a circuit board with a CPU and semi-standard I/O ports), but especially when related to audio, MIDI, gaming, and/or the Internet. My skills are best employed in web development, where I have the most experience and most of my current personal projects lie, but I am able to learn skills in other development areas quickly.
