### glinnO
My senior capstone project for the IT Innovation major at The University of Nebraska at Omaha. GlinnO is a web application to share a calendar of music events in Omaha, Nebraska, by allowing users to create accounts, and with proper permissions, add events. Provides extensive database administration and security. Built with the UserFrosting PHP user management application and framework, PostgreSQL, and the Apache web server.

The technical report is from the first semester, during project planning. At this time, the implementation of the project had not yet begun. The UI and functionality is consequently sightly different from stated. The name was also ApollOm and later changed to glinnO.

Mobile applications were designed by other teams in a whole class project for the Agile Development Methods course at The University of Nebraska at Omaha.
