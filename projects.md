### glinnO
My senior capstone project for the IT Innovation major at The University of Nebraska at Omaha. GlinnO is a web application to share a calendar of music events in Omaha, Nebraska, by allowing users to create accounts, and with proper permissions, add events. It provides extensive database administration and security. Built with the UserFrosting PHP user management application and framework, PostgreSQL, and the Apache web server. I conducted all sprint planning, development, testing, and sprint review and retrospectives.  The technical report is from the first semester, during project planning. At this time, the implementation of the project had not yet begun. The resultant UI and functionality is consequently sightly different than stated. The name was also ApollOm and later changed to glinnO.

### Nebraska Watershed Network
A project for the Nebraska Watershed Network operating out of The University of Nebraska at Omaha to assist with field data collection from citizen scientists with both web and Android/iOS mobile applications. I oversaw sprint planning for the web development team, who built the project with CakePHP and Bootstrap. Mobile applications were designed by other teams. I led the web team in the use of the SCRUM agile development system, ensured regular discussion between team members, and lead the review and retrospective sessions for the web team.
